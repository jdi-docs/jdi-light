# JDI Light Framework
JDI Light is a powerful Test Automation Framework that helps to make your tests fast, sustainable and provides obvious and predictable test run results.

JDI Light is powered by Selenium and has simple integration with Selenium-based projects.

![Allure Log](images/intro/allure-report-log.png)

# Highlights
- Has simple integration with any Selenium-based project, allowing to increase overall project stability, add user action logs and enrich standard WebElement capabilities with new features in just minutes.
- Complements the Page Object pattern with powerful pre-made UI Elements: Buttons, TextFields, Forms, Tables and many others.
- Enables you to write stable and predictable tests that fail only because of business logic or layout changes. No more waits, thread sleeps and other flaky stuff.
- Increases your overall test execution speed, especially for complex cases like searching huge tables, selecting dropdown items out of a hundred or entering text containing thousands of lines.
- Provides detailed logs and well-readable reports of all user actions with no additional effort.
- All UI Elements have assertions/matchers powered by Hamcrest and a wait with expected condition during timeout.
- Easy integration with all modern automation tools: ***CI*** (*Jenkins*, *TC* etc.), ***logging*** (*Log4j* or any other *slf4j*-based logs), ***reporting*** (*Allure* or *Report Portal*); ***browser/device farms*** (*Selenium Grid*, *BrowserStack*, *Selenoid* etc.), ***test runners*** (*TestNG*, *JUnit*) etc.

# Navigation
[Introduction](https://jdi-docs.github.io/jdi-light/?java#introduction) provides examples of common test automation tasks solved with JDI Light.

[Tutorial](https://jdi-docs.github.io/jdi-light/?java#tutorial) walks you through adding JDI Light to your project, implementing test scenarios and using UI Elements. You also get to see how much JDI Light reduces the needed effort, compared to pure Selenium.

[Theory](https://jdi-docs.github.io/jdi-light/?java#theory) addresses the key principles behind JDI Light framework and the tools it offers to put these principles into practice.

[Documentation](https://jdi-docs.github.io/jdi-light/?java#documentation) contains technical description of JDI Light features and UI Element sets.
